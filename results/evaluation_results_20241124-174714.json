Determine the useful life of the trademarks.\n3. Calculate the annual amortization expense by dividing the carrying value by the useful life.\n\nHowever, the context does not provide the carrying value of the trademarks or any information about the intangibles other than their useful lives. Since we don't have the carrying value, we can't calculate the exact yearly amortization expense. But if we assume that the carrying value is the same as the fair value (which is a common assumption in such cases without additional information), we can use the useful life provided for trademarks, which is 9 years.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide the carrying value, let's assume it's a hypothetical value and proceed with the given useful life of 9 years. If we had the carrying value, we would divide it by 9 to get the yearly amortization expense.\n\nBut since the question asks for the average yearly amoritization expense related to trademarks and we don't have the carrying value, we can only provide the formula for the calculation:\n\nAnnual Amortization Expense = Carrying Value of Trademarks / Useful Life of Trademark\n\nGiven the useful life is 9 years, if we had the carrying value (V), the formula would be:\n\nAnnual Amortization Expense = V / 9\n\nSince we don't have the carrying value, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the carrying value is known and provided in a real scenario, we would use that value in the formula.\n\nFor the sake of this exercise, let's assume the carrying value of the trademarks is $81 (this is an arbitrary number for illustration purposes only).\n\nAnnual Amortization Expense = $81 / 9 = $9\n\nSo, if the carrying value of the trademarks was $81, the average yearly amortization expense would be:\n\nFINALANSWER: 9.00"

Therefore, we need to subtract $221 million from the target operating cash flow to find the actual operating cash flow.\n\nLet's do the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Actual operating cash flow} = \\$3.70 \\text{ billion} - \\$0.221 \\text{ billion} = \\$3.479 \\text{ billion} \\]\n\nSo, the actual operating cash flow reported for 2011 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.479}\n\\]"

Determine the book value (or cost) of the starter brand business.\n3. Calculate the gain by subtracting the book value from the cash received.\n4. Convert the gain into a percentage of the book value.\n\nLet's start with step 1: The amount of cash received from the sale is $60.0 million.\n\nNext, for step 2: The book value (or cost) of the starter brand business is not directly given in the context. However, we can infer that the book value is the same as the cash payment made, which is $31.4 million (since the gain is $28.6 million and the cash received is $60.0 million).\n\nNow, for step 3: The gain is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Gain} = \\text{Cash Received} - \\text{Book Value} = 60.0 - 31.4 = 28.6 \\text{ million dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, for step 4: To find the percentage gain, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Gain} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gain}}{\\text{Book Value}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Gain} = \\left( \\frac{28.6}{31.4} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 91.13\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage gain on the sale of the starter brand business is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9113} \\]"

Identify the depreciation values for 2013 and 2012 from the context.\n2. Calculate the difference between the two years' depreciation values.\n\nFrom the context:\n- Depreciation in 2013 was up 7% compared to 2012.\n- Depreciation in 2012 was not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the fact that depreciation in 2013 was up 7% compared to 2012.\n\nLet's denote the depreciation in 2012 as \\( D_{2012} \\). Then the depreciation in 2013 is \\( D_{2013} = D_{2012} + 0.07D_{2012} = 1.07D_{2012} \\).\n\nThe increase in depreciation from 2012 to 2013 is:\n\\[ D_{2013} - D_{2012} = 1.07D_{2012} - D_{2012} = 0.07D_{2012} \\]\n\nSince the problem asks for the total increase in depreciation for 2013 and 2012, we need to consider that the increase in 2012 was zero (since no previous year's data is provided), so the total increase is just the increase from 2013:\n\\[ \\text{Total increase} = 0.07D_{2012} \\]\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide the actual value of \\( D_{2012} \\). Since we are asked for the percentage increase and the problem states that depreciation was up 7% in 2013 compared to 2012, we can conclude that the total increase in depreciation for 2013 and 2012 is:\n\\[ \\text{Total increase} = 7\\% \\]\n\nConverting this percentage to a decimal form:\n\\[ 7\\% = 0.07 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.07} \\]"
